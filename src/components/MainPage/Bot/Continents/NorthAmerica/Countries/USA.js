                The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United
                States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country comprising 50
                states, a federal district, five major self-governing
                territories, and various possessions.[h] At 3.8 million square
                miles (9.8 million km2), the United States is the world's third
                or fourth largest country by total area[d] and is slightly
                smaller than the entire continent of Europe's 3.9 million square
                miles (10.1 million km2). With a population of more than 327
                million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country. The
                capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New
                York City. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district
                are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico. The
                State of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America,
                bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from
                Russia to the west. The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the
                mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the
                Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine
                official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate,
                and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17
                megadiverse countries.

                Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American
                mainland at least 12,000 years ago.[23] European colonization
                began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the
                thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast.
                Following the French and Indian War, numerous disputes between
                Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution,
                which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of
                Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United
                States becoming the first country to gain independence from a
                European power.[24] The current constitution was adopted in
                1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill
                of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental
                civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous
                expansion across North America throughout the 19th century,
                acquiring new territories,[25] displacing Native American
                tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the
                continent by 1848.

                During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to
                the abolition of slavery.[26][27] By the end of the century, the
                United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean,[28] and its
                economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution,
                began to soar.[29] The Spanishâ€“American War and World War I
                confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The
                United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower,
                the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country
                to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United
                Nations Security Council. Sweeping civil rights legislation,
                notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of
                1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, outlawed discrimination
                based on race or color. During the Cold War, the United States
                and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating
                with the 1969 U.S. Moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the
                collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as
                the world's sole superpower.

                A multicultural country, the United States is the world's oldest
                surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a
                representative democracy. The United States is a founding member
                of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund,
                Organization of American States (OAS), and other international
                organizations. The United States is a highly developed country,
                with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and
                second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a
                quarter of global GDP.[31] The U.S. economy is largely
                post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and
                knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector
                remains the second-largest in the world.[32] The United States
                is the world's largest importer and the second largest exporter
                of goods, by value.[33][34] Although its population is only 4.3%
                of the world total,[35] the U.S. holds 31% of the total wealth
                in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in
                a single country.

                Despite income and wealth disparities, the United States
                continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic
                performance, including average wage, human development, per
                capita GDP, and worker productivity.[37][38] The United States
                is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third
                of global military spending,[39] and is a leading political,
                cultural, and scientific force internationally.
